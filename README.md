Call Center availability
========================

## Problem Description

A call centre's operating hours are

 - Monday to Wednesday: 9am to 6pm
 - Thursday and Friday: 9am to 8pm
 - Saturday: 9am to 12:30pm
 - Sunday: Closed
 
The call centre will accept pre-booked calls under the following conditions:
 - A callback time cannot be out of hours on any day
 - A callback time cannot be earlier than 2 hours in the future.
 - A Callback time cannot be more than 6 working days in the future.


## Task
- Write a class or module which, when given a requested time for a pre-booked call, will give a response to say whether or not that is a valid time.
- Treat this as a pair-programming exercise, using TDD, and explaining your thought processes as you go.
- You may not have enough time to complete all the tasks; that is not important.  We are looking to see your
thought processes, the way you go about solving the problem, and code quality.
